IMPORTANT: The AI needs "Thinking Time" to become smart!

Launch the Bot: Run python nhibee.py.

The Initialization Phase: * Upon startup, the bot will collect the last 1,000 M5 candles from MT5.

It will then perform Local Training (Random Forest) to adapt to the current market trend.

Wait for 1-2 minutes until the chart appears and the status shows "AI Training Complete".

The Observation Phase (Crucial):

DO NOT trade immediately. The AI requires live data to sync with the trained model.

Let the bot run for at least 15-30 minutes to observe live price action.

The longer it runs, the more accurate its predictions become as it accumulates real-time data.

Auto-Trading: Once the "Signal Strength" is stable, the bot will automatically execute trades based on its AI confidence.
The Standard version is locked with Lot 0.01. To unlock all features:
For Educational Use Only: This software is provided for testing and educational purposes. Trading involves significant risk.

Financial Risk: We are not responsible for any financial losses, damages, or account drawdowns incurred from the use of this AI Bot.

No Guarantees: Past performance (AI training on 1000 candles) does not guarantee future results in live market conditions.

User Responsibility: By using this software, you agree that you are trading at your own risk and have fully tested the bot on a Demo account before going Live.
